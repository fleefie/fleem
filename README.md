I don't know who tried to make the official ``lazy.nvim`` install guides and at this point I'm too affraid to ask. I really disliked their file structure so I just stole NVChad's.

Also FYI: I am, let's say... SEVERELY inspired by LunarVim. I really enjoyed their lualine setup and yoinked a few of their utility functions here and there.

This is meant to be my personal config, or something. If you can't understand how it works just from the file structure and lua comments, I've become the very thing I swore to destroy.

The point of my config files is to be understandable by anyone that doesn't understand lua too well. Don't worry, it's not too complicated, the comments should explain what everything does well enough for whoever is reading this to be able to modify these as they please. I mean, if I could figure it out, surely you can too. Hopefully. Who knows!

Also feel free to use this or whatever. Honestly I don't even care about hosting this on github, I'm genuinely just abusing Microsoft's servers as a free backup tool. Might as well make it available to anyone.

WARNING: Severely very well opinionated with bad opinions.
