My neovim ig

Has a functional and robust LSP setup so im happy enough man

started out as a fork of the minimal nvchad config but I kind of ended up making my own thing. Also I shamelessly stole a ton from lunarvim. But hey copy pasting makes me a TRUE developer right?

idk feel free to use this or sum. Or just look around.

TODO: add a way to crash the system running this config if any webdev-related things are detected to be running on fleem.
